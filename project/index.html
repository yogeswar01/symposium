            <h2>SCRAMBLED EGGS</h2>
            <p>Scrambled Eggs is a fun and engaging memory-based game that challenges participants to observe and recall details quickly. With a blindfolded catcher trying to identify the player who has shifted his/her place, the game tests attentiveness, strategy, and quick thinking, making for an exciting and interactive experience.</p>
            
            <h3>EVENT FORMAT:</h3>
            <p>One participant is selected as the catcher and asked to observe the seating positions of the other participants. He is then blindfolded. Once the catcher is blindfolded, a player is selected and given a brief moment to change his/her place. Then, the catcher removes the blindfold and tries to identify who has moved by observing seating positions, clothing, or other identifiers. The game ends when the catcher identifies the respective player or the time runs out. If the catcher guesses correctly, the respective player becomes the new catcher for the next round. If the guess is incorrect, the catcher gets eliminated and the game continues.</p>

            <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Participants must stay silent and avoid giving hints.</li>
                <li>The catcher cannot touch other players while blindfolded.</li>
                <li>Players should move quickly and quietly to avoid detection.</li>
                <li>Each round has a fixed time limit.</li>

                <li>Decisions by the organizers are final.</li>
